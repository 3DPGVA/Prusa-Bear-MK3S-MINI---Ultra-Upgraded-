Prusa Bear MK3S MINI Ultra-Upgraded V1.0

Introduction

The MK3S Bear for MINI Upgrade replaces the original Prusa MINI frame with a more rigid and reliable solution also it replaces the bowden to direct drive and dual Z-Axis. It allows faster prints, increases precision, makes maintenance easier and opens the door to more customization.



Here are the features that explain why we decided to create another printer upgrade.

    Use as much as possible original parts (the MINI firmware stays intact)
    Compatible with Prusa MINI
    
    Highly detailed manual
    Use more aluminum and less printed parts (3D printed parts can crack and are less reliable)
   
    Other type of aluminum extrusions can be supported thanks to parametric design (check Fusion 360 files)
    3D printed parts designed using advanced techniques like selective infill, clean vertical holes, sharp angle...
    Open source by providing STL, STEP and Autodesk Fusion 360 files

 
The original parts from the designers that you have to use them as they are, are the following:
